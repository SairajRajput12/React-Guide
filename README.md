# React Project

Welcome to our React project! This project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Below you'll find instructions on how to get started with the project and how to contribute.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```
   cd react-project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**  
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a development server and open the project in your default web browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files, and scripts into the app directory. This is a one-way operation.
